#TODO:
1. rewrite the serialization mechanism - the serialization of models can be automatic also
2. <strike> finish creating the csv loader </strike>
3. write an IEAT tree implementation - this should be inside a new original algorithms project
4. <strike> seperate metadata from instance store </strike>
5. <strike> transform dataset into a set of less abstract and general datasets - will both contribute to speed and implementation simplicity </strike>
6. update algorithms to support the new format - should be easy
